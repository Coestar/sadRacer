# SAD Racer

An on-stream project to build an old-school pseudo 3D racer as a stream theme.

## Some initial notes

Initital state of the code is a bit disasterous as this is still mostly a guide-following prototype. Please forgive me.

Feel free to clone/fork/etc. however you like, but I'm not sure yet on whether I'll be accepting PRs. One of the objectives of this project for me is to learn, so I want to avoid taking completed stuff whole-cloth without understanding it myself.

## Installation/running

Nothing fancy here - everything you need is included. Just open index.html in any browser and you should be off to the races, so to speak.
